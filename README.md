## Deploying the Coworking Analytics Application

This guide details the deployment process for the Coworking Analytics application. It outlines the technologies and tools used, along with insights into the release cycle for new builds.

### **Understanding the Architecture:**

The application leverages a containerized Flask Python backend, to interact with a Postgres database. Containerization is achieved using Docker, and deployment is managed by Kubernetes.

### Technologies and Tools Overview

#### Local Environment
- **Python Environment** (optional): Python 3.6+ and `pip` for installing Python dependencies.
- **Docker CLI**: Used to build and run Docker images locally.
- **kubectl**: Command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes clusters.
- **helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes, used to apply Helm Charts.

#### Remote Resources
- **AWS CodeBuild**: AWS service for building Docker images remotely.
- **AWS ECR**: Elastic Container Registry for hosting Docker images.
- **Kubernetes Environment with AWS EKS**: Kubernetes cluster for running applications.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring service for tracking activity and logs in EKS.
- **GitHub**: Version control platform for managing codebase.

### **Deployment Stages:**

1. **Local Development:**
    * Configure a local Postgres database using a Helm chart (e.g., Bitnami Postgres Chart).
    * Build the Docker image locally using `docker build --rm -t coworking .`.
    * Set up a Python development environment with `pip` for dependency management.
    * Run the application locally with `python app.py`, ensuring proper environment variables are set for database connection.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * AWS CodeBuild use `buildspec.yaml` to automate the following steps on code commit:
        * Build the Docker image using the local Dockerfile.
        * Push the built image to a private container registry AWS ECR.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment:**
    * The Kubernetes deployment YAML files (Deployment and Service) in `deployments` is used to manage the application lifecycle and service discovery.
    * Update the deployment YAML with the newly built image tag from ECR.
    * Utilize `kubectl apply` to deploy the updated configuration to the Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Monitoring:**
    * Leverage AWS CloudWatch to monitor application logs and gain insights into its health and performance.

### **Releasing New Builds:**

1. Make code changes and commit them to your version control system (e.g., Git).
2. The CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers on commit, building and pushing a new Docker image to ECR.
3. Update the deployment YAML with the new image tag referencing the latest ECR image.
4. Deploy the updated configuration using `kubectl apply` to initiate a rolling update in Kubernetes. The new pods with the updated image will gradually replace the existing ones, minimizing downtime.

### **Additional Considerations / Suggestions:**

1. **Memory and CPU allocation:** Analyze application resource utilization through monitoring tools. Start with a conservative allocation and scale up based on observed usage patterns. Then we can define memory requests and limits to ensure pods have guaranteed resources and prevent resource starvation.

2. **AWS instance type:** t3/small would be the best instance type for the application. T instances provide burstable CPU credits for occasional spikes in demand while offering lower baseline costs compared to constantly high-performing instance types.

3. **Cost Saving Strategies:** Utilize AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on application load. This ensures you only pay for the resources you actually use. Explore spot instances for unpredictable workloads. Spot instances offer significant cost savings but come with the risk of interruption. Consider using them for non-critical tasks.
